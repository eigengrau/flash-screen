Flash-Screen
============

``flash-screen`` makes the screen flash and emits a shutter sound. It
is intended to complement custom screenshotting scripts built around
maim_, to provide visual feedback when a screenshot has been
triggered.

.. _maim: https://github.com/naelstrof/maim

The screen flashing code has been <del>stolen</del> borrowed from
the Gnome screenshot application.

``flash-screen`` depends on GTK+ 3 and libcanberra.
